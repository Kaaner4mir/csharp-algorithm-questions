# csharp-algorithm-questions

A collection of basic algorithm exercises in C#. Each folder is a console app with 10 questions; solutions live in `Program.cs` as commented `#region` blocks. Uncomment the block you want to run and execute it.

## Requirements

- .NET 8 SDK
- Optional: Visual Studio / VS Code / Rider

All projects are simple `net8.0` console applications.

## Contents (summary)

- 1‑10: grade average, min/max, conditional counting, input validation, age ranges, squaring numbers, weighted grade, multiplication, square then digit product.
- 11‑20: multiples of 5, product of negatives, halve/ double based on value, commission calc, circle perimeter/area, dynamic list min‑max, nested clock loops, convert 100‑point grade to 5‑point, month name by number, letter grade calc.
- 21‑30: perfect number check, positive divisors, fuel cost, hypotenuse, BMI, multiplication table, student id builder, triangle type, random name generator, primes in a range.
- 31‑40: weekday number/name conversions, VAT calc, total duration, four‑op calculator, random multiplications, month name by number, name check loop, squares list, division via subtraction.

> Note: The listed ranges are illustrative; the project already includes more questions and will grow further.

Detailed prompts live in each `Program.cs` inside the relevant `#region` blocks.

## Run

1. Go to the folder you want (e.g., `Question_1-10`).
2. Uncomment the `#region` block for the question you want to run.
3. Build and run:
   ```shell
   dotnet run
   ```

To build the whole solution:
```shell
dotnet build AlgorithmQuestions.sln
```
